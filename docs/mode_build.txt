SYNOPSIS

    rmapalign3n build <database> <sequence file/directory>... [OPTION]...

    rmapalign3n build <database> [OPTION]... <sequence file/directory>...


DESCRIPTION

    Create a new database of reference sequences.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS

    <database>        database file name;
                      A database contains min-hash signatures
                      of reference sequences.

    <sequence file/directory>...
                      FASTA or FASTQ files containing sequences.
                      If directory names are given, they will be searched for
                      sequence files (at most 10 levels deep).


SKETCHING 

    -conv <o> <r>     nucleotide conversion (o)riginal -> (r)eplacement
                      example usage for BS-seq: -conv C T
                      default: C T

    -kmerlen <k>      number of nucleotides/characters in a k-mer
                      default: 16

    -sketchlen <s>    number of features (k-mer hashes) per sampling window
                      default: 16

    -winlen <w>       number of letters in each sampling window
                      default: 64

    -winstride <l>    distance between window starting positions
                      default: 49  (w-k+1)


ADVANCED OPTIONS

    -max-locations-per-feature <#>
                      maximum number of reference sequence locations to be
                      stored per feature;
                      If the value is too high it will significantly impact
                      querying speed. Note that an upper hard limit is always
                      imposed by the data type used for the hash table bucket
                      size (set with compilation macro
                      '-DRMA_LOCATION_LIST_SIZE_TYPE').Can also be set in query
                      mode.
                      default: 254

    -remove-overpopulated-features
                      Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed
                      amount of locations per feature. This can improve querying
                      speed and can be used to remove non-discriminative
                      features.Can also be set in query mode.
                      default: on

    -max-ambig-per-feature <#>
                      Maximum number of allowed different reference sequences
                      per feature. Removes all features exceeding this limit
                      from database.
                      default: off

    -max-load-fac <factor>
                      maximum hash table load factor;
                      This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                      for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve
                      speed, a larger one will improve memory efficiency.
                      default: 0.800000

EXAMPLES

    Build database 'mydb' from sequence file 'reference.fa':
        rmapalign3n build mydb reference.fa

    Build database 'mydb' from two sequence files:
        rmapalign3n build mydb one.fa two.fa

    Build database 'mydb' from folder containing sequence files:
        rmapalign3n build mydb references_folder
